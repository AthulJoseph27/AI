# T-Rex Runner

- Thanks to **Shivam Shekhar** for the T-Rex runner game source code. Check out his project [here](https://code-projects.org/dino-game-in-python-with-source-code/).

- I have implemented the AI on top of the T-Rex runner game using neat module.

- You will need python3 to run this.

- To install the required modules, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- Run `python3 TRex_AI.py` to see the AI in action.

- By default, it runs on a pre-trained model, to train a model from scratch, you will have to comment out the testing section of the code (line 552 - 554) and uncomment the training section of the code (line 537 - 547).
